-Slumber-


*Premise*

Black Engine Games was a company comprised of recent Full Sail graduates.

Slumber was a project created by Black Engine Games following the release of Gravity Well.
For Gravity Well, I created edited audio logs but was brought on board as a level designer 
for Slumber.

As time went on, however, I gained the opportunity to start building things using Unreal Engines
Blueprint feature.

Because Slumber was a collaborative project, there is a limited amount of information
that I am willing to share. The screenshots included show a tower level blockout I made
as well as a test level for the AI I created, and an example of the AI chasing the player.


*Things I Learned*

-Basic Crafting System using Blueprints
-Basic Level Design
-Creating Blockouts using Geometry tools
-Inheritance
-Polymorphism
-Interfaces
-Creating AI using Blueprints (Pawns, Controllers, Characters, BehaviorTrees, Blackboards)
-Services + Tasks
