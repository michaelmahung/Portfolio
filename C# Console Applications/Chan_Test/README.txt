*Premise*

This console application is my interpretation of an exercise out of the book:
Learn C# in One Day and Learn it Well by Jamie Chan.

I used this project as an area to try out different ideas as well as different string
formatting techniques. 


*What I Learned*

-Variable Scope
-String Formatting
-Thread Sleeping
-Return Functions
