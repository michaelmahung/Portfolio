*Premise*

This project was something I did because I wanted to use music as a game mechanic.
Origionally, the idea was inspired by the game 140, and I wanted the player to have
to listen for different musical cues to progress in the game.


*What I Learned*

In creating this project I ended up reaching out to several other game developers.
On of which was Super Hexagon's Terry Cavanagh. In doing so I realised that oftentimes,
the most obvious solution may not be the best one, and that the best solution availble is 
the one that works.
