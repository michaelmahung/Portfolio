-Video Test-


*Premise*

This was one of my first projects, the idea was to show a person a video clip and quiz them on the clip afterwards.

The end goal was to have a youtube-like platform where instead of just watching videos,
you would watch videos and get points by doing the quiz afterwards.

The points you earn can be redeemed for coupons and discounts for affiliated companies.


*What I Learned*

This project taught me a lot about proper organization and planning. 

I realised quickly that the scope of my idea was much too large to do with my current skillset,
But I tried my best to implement the initial features and shelf the project until I felt ready
to continue with it.
