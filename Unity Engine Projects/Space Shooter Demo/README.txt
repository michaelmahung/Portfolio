-Space Shooter Demo-


*Premise*

This tutorial was my introduction to the Unity Game Engine.

Suffice to say, I struggled with almost every part of this demo but still managed to get things
working as intended. 


*What I Learned*

I learned that I had a lot to learn through this project. This was the first time I wrote
a line of code, and I immediately felt captivated and somewhat intimidated by the sheer
amount of information presented. I went on the create the Roll-A-Ball demo on the Unity website
and from there, starting creating my own projects.
