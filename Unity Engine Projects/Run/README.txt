*Premise*

I created this project with a combination of a Games Plus James Tutorial
and my own scripts.

This project took a fair amount of time for me to complete, but I also removed
a lot of the initial intimidation from my mind. I had a lot of fun working on this project,
as well as adding music and sound effects.
