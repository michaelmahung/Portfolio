-CheckMe-


*Premise*

After releasing Resource Pit for Android, I realised that part of why Apple may not be approving
the app for iOS is because the app is not native but instead built from hand in a game engine.

As a result, I found out about Xamarin Forms and thought it would be a good idea to try
rebuilding the project to work as a native crossplatform application.

CheckMe is still in development, and I am still learning the tools, but this is my first
exposure to Xamarin development.
